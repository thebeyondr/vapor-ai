<objective>
Build the model discovery foundation: HuggingFace client, curated Liquid AI LFM catalog with modality groupings, and model card UI on the training page.

Purpose: Users land on the training page and immediately see Liquid AI's model lineup organized by what they do (text, vision, audio, nano). This is the core browsing experience before search.
Output: Training page with curated LFM section, model cards, and fallback-ready HF client.

  <name>Task 1: HuggingFace types, client, and curated LFM data</name>
  <files>lib/huggingface/types.ts, lib/huggingface/client.ts, lib/huggingface/liquid-lfm.ts</files>
  <action>
Install dependencies: `pnpm add @huggingface/hub use-debounce` (install both now, use-debounce needed in plan 02).

Create `lib/huggingface/types.ts`:
- Export `ModelModality` type: "text" | "vision" | "audio" | "nano"
- Export `ModelInfo` interface: { id: string, name: string, modality: ModelModality, description: string, parameterCount: string, architecture: string, downloads?: number, tags?: string[] }

Create `lib/huggingface/liquid-lfm.ts`:
- Export `LIQUID_LFMS: ModelInfo[]` — curated static list of Liquid AI models. Include real models from HuggingFace LiquidAI org:
  - Text: LFM2-1.2B (1.2B params, text generation), LFM2-350M (350M params, nano/edge)
  - Vision: LFM2.5-VL-1.6B (1.6B params, vision-language)
  - Audio: LFM2.5-Audio-1.5B (1.5B params, audio understanding)
  - Add 1-2 more per modality if real models exist; otherwise stick to known ones
- Each entry has a human-written description emphasizing what makes it special (efficiency, edge deployment, multimodal)
- Export `LIQUID_LFMS_BY_MODALITY`: Record<ModelModality, ModelInfo[]> — grouped version
- Export `MODALITY_META`: Record<ModelModality, { label: string, icon: string, description: string }> — metadata for section headers (icon names from lucide-react: "Type" for text, "Eye" for vision, "AudioLines" for audio, "Cpu" for nano)

Create `lib/huggingface/client.ts`:
- Import `listModels` from `@huggingface/hub`
- Export `getLiquidModels()`: tries HuggingFace API with `search: { owner: "LiquidAI" }`, maps results to `ModelInfo[]`, falls back to `LIQUID_LFMS` on any error. Log warning on fallback. Use optional `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` env var (don't require it — public models work without auth).
- Do NOT add HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN to lib/env.ts Zod schema as required — it's optional. Access via `process.env.HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` directly.
  </action>
  <verify>
`pnpm build` succeeds. Import types and data in a test: `node -e "const m = require('./lib/huggingface/liquid-lfm'); console.log(Object.keys(m.LIQUID_LFMS_BY_MODALITY))"` — should print modality keys (may need tsx for ESM).
  </verify>
  <done>Types exported, 4+ curated LFMs with modality groupings, HF client with API-first + static fallback.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Model card component and curated LFM section on training page</name>
  <files>app/(dashboard)/training/components/model-card.tsx, app/(dashboard)/training/components/liquid-lfm-section.tsx, app/(dashboard)/training/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create `app/(dashboard)/training/components/model-card.tsx` (Server Component):
- Props: `model: ModelInfo`
- Use ShadCN Card component. Display: model name (bold), architecture, parameter count as badge, description (text-muted-foreground, line-clamp-2), downloads count if available
- Add a subtle modality indicator (small colored dot or badge in corner)
- Keep it clean and scannable — this is a portfolio piece targeting Liquid AI

Create `app/(dashboard)/training/components/liquid-lfm-section.tsx` (Server Component):
- Props: `modelsByModality: Record<ModelModality, ModelInfo[]>`
- Render each modality as a section with: icon (from MODALITY_META, use lucide-react), label, description
- Within each section, render ModelCard in a responsive grid: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4`
- Use ShadCN Separator between modality sections
- If a modality group is empty, don't render that section

Update `app/(dashboard)/training/page.tsx`:
- Make it an async Server Component
- Call `getLiquidModels()` at the top (server-side fetch)
- Group results by modality (use LIQUID_LFMS_BY_MODALITY as structure reference, but map API results if available)
- Render page title "Model Discovery", subtitle, then LiquidLFMSection
- Leave a placeholder div with id="model-search" after the curated section (Plan 02 will add search here)
- Leave a placeholder div with id="ai-recommender" (Plan 03 will add recommender here)
  </action>
  <verify>
`pnpm build` succeeds. Visit http://localhost:3000/training — see curated Liquid LFMs grouped by modality with model cards showing name, params, architecture, description.
  </verify>
  <done>Training page displays curated Liquid AI models in modality-grouped sections with metadata-rich cards. Page renders server-side with graceful fallback.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `pnpm build` passes with no errors
- Training page at /training shows curated LFM sections
- Model cards display all required metadata fields
- If HuggingFace API is unreachable, static fallback data renders instead
- No "use client" directive on page.tsx or model-card.tsx (Server Components)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
User navigates to /training and sees Liquid AI models organized by modality (text, vision, audio, nano) with informative cards showing model name, parameter count, architecture, and description. Page works offline via static fallback data.
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-model-discovery/03-01-SUMMARY.md`
