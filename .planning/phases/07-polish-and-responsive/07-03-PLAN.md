<objective>
Visual verification of all Phase 7 polish work across viewports and interaction states.

Purpose: Polish is inherently visual -- automated tests can't verify "feels smooth" or "looks right on mobile." A human eye confirms the work meets portfolio quality.
Output: Verified polish across all pages and viewports.

  <name>Task 1: Visual verification of all Phase 7 polish</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Present the verification checklist to the user. Start the dev server if not running: `pnpm dev` (ensure Node >= 22).

    What was built: Complete Phase 7 polish including loading skeletons on all routes, empty states with icons and CTAs, smooth page transitions with Motion, responsive design across all viewports, prefers-reduced-motion support, and ML metric range constants.

    How to verify:

    **1. Loading States (skeletons)**
    - Open browser DevTools > Network tab > set throttling to "Slow 3G"
    - Navigate to http://localhost:3000 -- should see dashboard skeleton (metric card placeholders, recent jobs placeholder)
    - Navigate to /training -- should see model catalog skeleton
    - Navigate to /training/jobs -- should see card list skeleton
    - Navigate to /deployments -- should see table skeleton
    - Skeletons should match the final layout structure (no jarring layout shift when content loads)

    **2. Empty States**
    - If database has no data (or clear seed data), visit /training/jobs -- should see "No training jobs yet" with BrainCircuit icon and "New Training Job" CTA button
    - Visit /deployments with no deployments -- should see "No deployments yet" with Rocket icon and "View Training Jobs" CTA
    - Dashboard recent jobs section with no jobs -- should show icon + "Start Training" CTA

    **3. Page Transitions**
    - Set network back to normal speed
    - Click between Dashboard, Training, Training Jobs, Deployments in sidebar
    - Content should fade out (opacity + slight upward slide) then fade in
    - Transitions should feel quick and subtle (150ms), not slow or dramatic
    - No flash of unstyled content or layout jump

    **4. Reduced Motion**
    - In DevTools > Rendering > check "Emulate CSS prefers-reduced-motion: reduce"
    - Navigate between pages -- transitions should be instant (no visible animation)

    **5. Responsive Design (mobile)**
    - Toggle DevTools device toolbar to iPhone 14 (390px) or similar
    - Dashboard: metric cards stack to 1 column, header title + button stack vertically
    - Training Jobs: job cards show params stacked, header stacks
    - Deployments: table scrolls horizontally (not squished)
    - All pages: no horizontal overflow, text readable, buttons tappable

    **6. Responsive Design (tablet)**
    - Switch to iPad (768px)
    - Dashboard: metric cards 2-column grid
    - All content comfortably fits without horizontal scroll

    Resume signal: Type "approved" if polish meets expectations, or describe specific issues to fix.
