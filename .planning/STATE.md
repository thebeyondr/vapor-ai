## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Hybrid mock data approach (generated + HuggingFace API) for realism
- Match Liquid AI branding for targeted portfolio piece
- Single config page instead of wizard for demo simplicity
- 1-week sprint timeline: every screen must earn its place
- Neon DB for persistence (not JSON files)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 3 Research Needed:**
- HuggingFace API integration approach unclear (@huggingface/hub library existence unverified)
- Fallback to direct REST API if needed
- Research suggests prototyping API call early in Phase 3

**Phase 5 Research Needed:**
- Realistic training curve shapes for loss/accuracy simulation
- Research can improve realism but not blocking (can fake with exponential decay + noise)
